## **üß± BrickChain ‚Äì Tokenization dApp**

**Version:** 2.0 (Post-Hackathon PRD)  
 **Duration:** 9 weeks (to evolve into a production-ready MVP)  
 **Team:**

* Athar : (Docs, Testing, Architecture, Coordination)

* Ayush: (Smart Contracts \+ ZK Integration)

* Samarth: (API & Storage Systems)

* Akshad: (React, Wallet integration, UI/UX)

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Executive Summary**

BrickChain redefines property investment by turning real estate into **fractional, tradable digital tokens**, all while ensuring privacy and compliance through **zero-knowledge proofs**.

We aim to transition from a functional prototype to a **production-grade fullstack platform**, capable of handling real property onboarding, token minting, shielded transactions, and proof-based verifications ‚Äî with a clean UI, documentation, and modular architecture.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Problem & Vision**

**Problem:**  
 Traditional real estate transactions are slow, opaque, and exclusionary. Ownership verification requires paperwork, middlemen, and trust-heavy intermediaries.

**Vision:**  
 To build a **privacy-first, decentralized property exchange** where:

* Investors can **own fractions of real property**.

* Transactions remain **private yet verifiable**.

* Ownership proofs can be **shared selectively** with regulators or partners.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ User Personas & Use Cases**

### **üßçInvestor**

* Wants to buy fractional shares of verified properties securely.

* Needs to confirm ownership without leaking personal details.

### **üè† Property Owner**

* Wants to tokenize and sell property shares easily.

* Needs to prove legitimacy of property holdings privately.

### **üßæ Regulator**

* Needs to verify proof of ownership percentage without accessing full ledger data.

**Use Cases:**

1. Register property ‚Üí store proof on-chain.

2. Mint fractional tokens linked to the property.

3. Transfer tokens privately to investors.

4. Verify ownership via selective disclosure (ZKP).

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Core Features (Current)**

‚úÖ Property registration (hashed doc on-chain)  
 ‚úÖ Fractional token minting  
 ‚úÖ Private transfers (shielded)  
 ‚úÖ Ownership verification via ZK proof

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Proposed Improvements (Next 9 Weeks)**

| Area | Current | Improvement |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Architecture** | Single repo, mixed logic | Modular monorepo: `/frontend`, `/contracts`, `/backend`, `/zk` |
| **Smart Contracts** | Prototype in Midnight Compact | Add role-based access control, property metadata struct, ownership tracking, test coverage |
| **Backend** | Simple Node wrapper | Introduce service layer with property registry DB (Postgres/SQLite), ZK proof cache, API for frontend |
| **Frontend** | Basic UI | Add wallet connection, dashboard for properties, ZK verification UI, TX history, and dark theme |
| **Storage** | Local/IPFS mock | Switch to proper IPFS pinning (e.g., Web3.Storage), fallback to local DB |
| **ZK Proofs** | Manual proof calls | Automate proof generation & verification flow through backend SDK wrapper |
| **Testing & Docs** | Minimal | Full API docs (Swagger), smart contract test suite, frontend test coverage |
| **UX Additions** | Upload \+ transfer only | Add dashboard for: Owned Properties, Invested Shares, Activity Feed |
| **Security/Compliance** | Basic shielded tx | Add Proof-of-KYC stub (for future compliance), signature validation, proof verification logs |

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ System Architecture Overview**

**Frontend (React \+ Midnight.js SDK)**  
 ‚Üí Connect Wallet ‚Üí Register / Mint / Transfer UI  
 ‚Üí Calls backend REST API for off-chain components (IPFS hashes, proof generation, etc.)

**Backend (Node.js \+ Express)**  
 ‚Üí Wraps smart contracts (using SDK)  
 ‚Üí Handles file hashing, ZK proof request queue  
 ‚Üí Stores off-chain metadata (Postgres/SQLite)

**Smart Contracts (Midnight Compact)**  
 ‚Üí Defines `Property`, `TokenFraction`, `Transfer`, `Proof` modules  
 ‚Üí Shielded transfer functions  
 ‚Üí Events emitted for frontend listeners

**Storage**  
 ‚Üí IPFS for property documents  
 ‚Üí Local DB for mappings (PropertyID ‚Üî Hash ‚Üî Owner Wallet)
